#  DSA - Strings Practice (C++)

This repository contains my practice problems on **Strings using C++**, focused on solving real interview-level questions efficiently.

---

## Topics Covered

- String Reversal (Using 2 Pointers)
- Palindrome Check (With/Without Special Characters)
- Valid Palindrome (Leetcode Style)
- Anagram Check (Sorting + HashMap)
- Character Frequency
- String Compression (Leetcode)
- Sliding Window on Strings
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Substrings vs Subsequences
- Char Arrays vs Strings
- `getline()`, `substr()`, `tolower()`, etc.

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the `.cpp` files.
2. Open in **VS Code** or any C++ compiler.
3. Compile and run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output


This repo contains solutions to string manipulation problems in C++, such as:
Palindrome Check
 Anagram Detection
 Longest Common Prefix
 String Compression
 Valid Parentheses

 Language: C++  
 Updated: Regularly  
Goal: Strengthen string problem-solving skills for coding interviews.
